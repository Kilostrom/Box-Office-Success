# Box-Office-Success

This is a group project the coding was done between me and Mahesh Guduru. 
It looks into the box office success of movie; the data is mainly on DC and Marvel movies. To see the movie performance and using the data that was gather we can predict how a new movie would do base on past movies.

# What I learned

•	Converting currency strings to floats, handling missing values, and feature engineering

•	Data scaling, data splitting – train_test_split function, feature selection, model training, and validation – performance metrics (accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and AUC)

•	model selection - Built a logistic regression and random forest classifier model ( learn from my past mistake on my walmart sales prediction project and apply it here).
